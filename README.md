# godot-gifexporter
## This plugin is now depracated in favor of pure GDScript implementation by jegor377 https://github.com/jegor377/godot-gdgifexporter

Plugin adding a GifExporter singleton enabling export of Image objects as a GIF file.
Currently supports Windows and Linux, both 32 and 64 bit.

### Installation:
1. Clone this repository into your Godot projects addons folder - GDNative builds are already included in the repository.
2. Enable this plugin in Project Settings.
3. A new node `GifExporter` will now become available.

### Usage:
First create a new instance of GifExport node. Then you can call these methods:

1. Starts gif export:

`GifExporter.begin_export(filename: String, width: int, height: int, frame_delay: float, loop_count: int = 0, bit_depth: int = 8, dither: bool = false) -> bool`
- filename - full path with a filename ('/home/user/anim.gif')
- width, height - default frame dimmensions
- frame_delay - default delay between animation frames
- loop_count - how many times is animation repeated - 0 is infinite
- bit_depth - default frame color bit depth
- dither - default apply dithering algorithm to frames

The function returns false if it's called on an unsupported platform, true otherwise.

2. Adds a frame to gif:

`GifExporter.write_frame(frame : Image, background_color : Color, frame_delay : float, bit_depth : int = 8, dither : bool = false)`
- frame - Godot::Image object to write to file
- background_color - GIF don't support transparency - background color is applied as the background layer
- frame_delay - delay of this frame
- bit_depth - bit depth of this frame
- dither - apply dithering algorithm to frame

3. Finish gif exporting:

`GifExporter.end_export()`

### Compilation on Linux:
1. Init and compile godot_cpp submodule
  - Linux target uses GCC by default
  - `scons platform=linux generate_bindings=yes target=release bits=32`
  - `scons platform=linux generate_bindings=yes target=release bits=64`
  - Windows target requires mingw32 (on Arch in AUR as mingw-w64-gcc package)
  - `scons platform=windows generate_bindings=yes target=release bits=32`
  - `scons platform=windows generate_bindings=yes target=release bits=64`
  
2. Compile gifexporter
  - I assume all prerequisities from the previous step are installed
  - `scons p=x11 bits=32`
  - `scons p=x11 bits=64`
  - `scons p=windows bits=32`
  - `scons p=windows bits=64`
    - Windows libraries in bin/win have to have their suffix changed to .dll
  
3. Strip all resulting binaries of symbols with `strip` tool to greatly reduce size (godot-cpp seems to include a lot of symbols even in the release build)

### Changes to gifanimcplusplus
- This plugin uses https://github.com/fyngyrz/gifanimcplusplus
- Added includes of `cstding` and `cstring` libraries to `gifanim.h`
